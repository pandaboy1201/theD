        <h3>North Korea. <small>20/8/2017</small></h3>

North Korea has been conducting ballistic missle tests for months largely condemned by the international community. Even China, North Koreas main trade partner and ally has condemned these tests. According to Pentagon reports, North Korea has been successful in developing missile delivery technology which was previously thought to be years away.
<br><br>
Trump responded to the missile tests by stating, that North Korea <i>“would be met with fire and fury and frankly power, the likes of which this world has never seen before.”</i>
<br><br>
In response to the statements made by Trump North Korea (in concise and precise meaning) that Trump is an idiot and should be careful with his words while announcing that they have formulated detailed plans to launch nuclear military strikes on a strategic US military base in the Pacific.<b>Terrifying news because knowing the Presidents nature and his ego which is big enough to circum navigate the world, this situation could get worse, to the true meaning of the word.</b>
<br><br>
Just days later North Korea released propaganda images depicting North Koreas military arsenal destroying US forces and the White House. <b>The highly secluded and enclosed culture of North Korea has psychologically embedded a demonized American State since generations using such images. Basically North Koreans have been produced an image of Trump sitting in a dark room alone in the White House slowly chanting “Destroy North Korea” under his breath.</b>
<br><br>
Kim Jong-Un delayed the strike of 4 missiles to Guam. <b>Trump praised the Supreme leader in a tweet or in other words he thanked Kim for not being a complete psycho and obliterating an entire island. Trump also said in a tweet that the US is “locked and loaded” to counter any strikes from NK.</b>
<br><br>
The weeks were followed by a military parade by North Korea marking the 85TH year from the establishment of the Korean People’s Amy.
<br><br>
The US and South Korea will also be conducting a joint military exercise , the Pentagon said that this is only a “defense mechanism” but North Korea is considering this a <i>“dress rehearsal for war.”</i>
<br><br>
A report in <i>Rodong Sinmun</i>, the State publication of DPRK said , <i>“the US should pay heed to the statement of the DPRK government that we would not rule out the use of any final means.”</i> <b>An official way of saying “ are you sure, but are really sure, like really really sure? Hmm”</b>
<br><br>
<b><i>The war of words between the Trump administration and Pyongyang may seem like a really bone chilling cold war right now but taking into account the type of administrations these are, we could be headed for a really really hot war ending in the world being reduced to a nuclear wasteland.</i></b>
